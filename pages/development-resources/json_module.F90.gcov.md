The following report was automatically generated from
[gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) output by the
[FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS) Fortran build
tool. [gccr.pl](gccr.pl.html) was used to
merge [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) coverage
reports, and can be obtained at <https://github.com/eel3/gccr>. Any
procedures surrounded by double square brackets below are internal
procedures and do not have their own documentation page--documentation
for these procedures is included in the documentation of the scope in
which they are defined.

If procedure coverage is at 100%, also have a look at the
[Codecov.io coverage suggestions](https://codecov.io/github/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/features/suggestions).
