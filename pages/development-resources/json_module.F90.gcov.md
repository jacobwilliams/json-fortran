The following report was automatically generated from
[gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) output by the
[FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS) Fortran build
tool. [gccr.pl](|url|/page/development-resources/gccr.pl) was used to
merge [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) coverage
reports, and can be obtained at <https://github.com/eel3/gccr>. If
procedure coverage is at 100%, also have a look at the
[Codecov.io coverage suggestions](https://codecov.io/github/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/features/suggestions)
