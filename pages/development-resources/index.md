# Contributing

The guidlines for contributing to JSON-Fortran can be found

# Test Coverage Information

The best place to start when trying to increase test coverage, is to
look at the
[procedure level coverage report](json_module.F90.gcov.html)
automatically generated by
[FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS). If all procedures are
listed as covered, then please take a look at the
[Codecov.io coverage suggestions](https://codecov.io/github/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/features/suggestions?ref=master).
