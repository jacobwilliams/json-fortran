### [Unreleased](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/HEAD)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/7.1.0...HEAD)

**Enhancements:**

- Allow linking to JSON-Fortran from GFortran programs using
  [OpenCoarrays](https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/OpenCoarrays#readme)
  as the coarray runtime implementation. Use the
  `-DJSON_FORTRAN_USE_OpenCoarrays:BOOL=ON` option to cmake to enable
  this. (NOTE: The fact that this is required may be a bug in
  GFortran.)

### [7.1.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/7.1.0) (2019-06-23)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/7.0.0...7.1.0)
or [Download v7.1.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/7.1.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added a Visual Studio Code workspace file [\#399](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/399) [\#400](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/400) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Improvements to `json_value_get_child_by_index` efficiency [\#401](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/401) [\#402](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/402) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Updates to CMake install rule for better compatibility with Visual Studio [\#396](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/396) ([zbeekman](https://github.com/zbeekman))

**Bug fixes:**

- Fix for undeclared variable causing failing test on Mac [\#392](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/392) ([porteri](https://github.com/porteri))
- Fixed a bug where using `json%add()` to create new variables in a structure would stop the program if `stop_on_failure` was enabled. [\#403](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/403) [\#404](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/404) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [7.0.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/7.0.0) (2019-01-26)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.11.0...7.0.0)
or [Download v7.0.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/7.0.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added support for multiple real kinds:
  * The library now supports the default real kind specified (`real32`, `real64` and `real128`) as well as the kinds in this set with less precision than the default. For example, if `real64` is specified (which is the default), then both `real32` and `real64` are available in all the public APIs. Internally, the values are always stored in a variable of the default kind. [\#386](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/386) [\#387](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/387) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
  * Added a `create_real()` method and a `json_real` parameter to replace `create_double()` and `json_double`. The old versions are still available for backward compatibility.
  * Added CMake options to control integer and real kinds [\#284](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/284)
  * Updated the default real format statement to correctly correspond to the specified real kind.
- Added new `json_file` constructor functions for strings. This allows a `json_file` to be initialized using syntax such as: `f = json_file('{"x": 1}')`. [\#381](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/381) [\#382](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/382) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Fixed some links in the documentation.

**Bug fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where the parser would fail if the JSON structure was just a lone integer. [\#388](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/388) [\#389](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/389) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Fixed an issue where the unit tests did not compile when using `real32` or `real128`. [\#383](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/383) [\#384](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/384) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Fixed various issues preventing compilation if the integer kind was changed from the default. [\#365](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/365) [\#385](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/385) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Renamed the integrated tests preprocessor flag to `INTEGRATED_TESTS` since it was mispelled. [\#390](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/390) [\#391](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/391) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

- Fixed a bug in the `annotate_invalid_json()` routine. [\#355](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/355)
- Fixed an issue with the `jf_test_06` unit test failing on Windows. [\#357](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/357)

### [6.8.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.8.0) (2018-07-19)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.7.0...6.8.0)
or [Download v6.8.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.8.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added some additional checks so that the `destroy` method could still be used to destroy some malformed JSON linked lists. Also updated the `validate` method to check for circular references.
[\#346](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/346) [\#349](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/349) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Added missing arguments (`trim_str` and `adjustl_str`) to some of the string wrapper routines. [\#347](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/347) [\#348](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/348) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Various minor changes to remove some compiler warnings and a line length standards violation.
- Various documentation string updates.

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fixed a dangling pointer bug in the `destroy` method that was causing unpredictable behavior in this routine which could cause a crash for some compilers [\#307](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/307) [\#350](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/350) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.7.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.7.0) (2018-07-10)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.6.0...6.7.0)
or [Download v6.7.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.7.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Made the two arguments to `json_check_for_errors()` optional, so now either or both can be used. Note that if no error has been raised, then `error_msg` is now returned unallocated. [\#344](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/344) [\#345](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/345) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Added an additional error check in `json_value_print()` to check for an unassociated pointer. [\#342](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/342) [\#343](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/343) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

- Added additional error checks to `json_value_add_member()`. Now it will raise an exception if try to add a child to a non-array or non-object. [\#337](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/337) [\#338](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/338) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Added some additional unit tests to increase coverage [\#336](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/336) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fixed a bug in `json_value_clone_func()` where it could crash if attempting to clone an array element. Updated this routine to improve behavior when cloning an array element (the subsequent entries are no longer cloned). [\#334](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/334) [\#335](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/335) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.6.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.6.0) (2018-07-01)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.5.0...6.6.0)
or [Download v6.6.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.6.0)

**Enhancements [\#332](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/332) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))**

- Now, attempting to get a string variable as an integer, double, or logical will attempt to convert it to a string if `strict_type_checking=False`. Formerly these cases would raise an exception. [\#331](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/331)
- Fixed an inconsistency in `json_get_by_path()`. Now if using the optional `found` argument, any exceptions raised by this routine are cleared. [\#330](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/330)
- Changed the `name` argument in `json_value_remove_if_present()` to 'path' to be consistent with other routines since it is really a path. [\#329](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/329)
- Various documentation string updates.

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fixed a bug in `wrap_json_get_path()` where an optional argument was being used without checking if it was present. [\#333](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/333)

### [6.5.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.5.0) (2018-06-23)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.4.0...6.5.0)
or [Download v6.5.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.5.0)

**Enhancements & Fixed Issues:**

- Added optional `trim` and `adjustl` arguments were added to all the various routines for adding strings and string vectors to JSON [\#323](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/323) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- The `trailing_spaces_significant` flag is now respected for name keys when creating a JSON structure. [\#324](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/324) [\#326](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/326) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.4.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.4.0) (2018-06-10)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.3.0...6.4.0)
or [Download v6.4.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.4.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added optional `stop_on_error` argument to the various `initialize()` routines to immediately stop the program if an exception is raised. [\#318](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/318) [\#320](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/320) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

- Added routines to check if a name key is present in a `json_file` object, which is also available using the `.in.` operator. [\#316](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/316) [\#319](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/319) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

- Added routines to rename a json variable by specifying the path. [\#314](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/314) [\#317](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/317) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

- Added a Fobis rule for running the test programs. [\#321](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/321) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.3.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.3.0) (2018-04-20)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.2.0...6.3.0)
or [Download v6.3.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.3.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Add a FoBiS configuration file that can be used to build the library, tests, and documentation. [\#310](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/310) [\#311](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/311) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- CMake produced Visual Studio Project [\#70](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/70) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Minor changes: renamed some of the example files and reverted back to older versions of FoBiS and markdown for documentation building on Travis-CI [\#313](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/313) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

**Fixed issues:**

- Fixed a bug in the escaping logic where `/` characters in strings would not be printed under some circumstances. This bug was introduced in the 6.2.0 release. [\#312](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/312) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.2.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.2.0) (2018-03-10)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.1.0...6.2.0)
or [Download v6.2.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.2.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Allow the unit tests to be run from within the Visual Studio solution [\#295](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/295) ([Hugh-walsh](https://github.com/Hugh-walsh), [jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Compiling now works for the CMake-produced Visual Studio solution on Windows (note that the CMake-produced solution is a bit different from the other one provided). [\#70](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/70) [\#309](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/309) ([handrake0724](https://github.com/handrake0724), [jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Added a new option `escape_solidus` to specify if the forward slash ("`/`") is to be escaped when serializing JSON. By default, it is no longer escaped (this changes the behavior introduced in 6.0.0) [\#304](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/304) [\#305](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/305) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

**Fixed issues:**

- Fixed an issue causing a problem with the NAG compiler [\#303](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/303) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [6.1.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.1.0) (2017-11-05)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/6.0.0...6.1.0)
or [Download v6.1.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.1.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added an optional `allow_duplicate_keys` argument to the various `initialize` routines. This is True by default. If False, then duplicate keys are considered an error. Also added `check_for_duplicate_keys` and `check_children_for_duplicate_keys` methods that can be called. [\#250](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/250) [\#290](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/290) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Added support for JSONPath "bracket-notation" mode for specifying paths to JSON variables. [\#266](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/266) [\#292](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/292) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

**Fixed issues:**

- Replaced `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` with `INSTALL_LIB_DIR` in the CMake project. [\#286](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/286)  ([foeroyingur](https://github.com/foeroyingur))
- Fixed bug in the `lowercase_string` routine that could cause a crash for Debug builds. [\#293](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/293)  [\#294](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/294) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))


### [6.0.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/6.0.0) (2017-08-24)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/5.3.0...6.0.0)
or [Download v6.0.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/6.0.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Added a routine to reverse an array or object [\#280](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/280) [\#281](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/281) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

**Fixed issues:**

- Fixed a bug where using `no_whitespace` mode could still print line breaks in some cases [\#288](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/288) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))
- Strings (name key and value) were not being properly escaped/unescaped in some contexts. This change introduces a small backward incompatibility (formerly, if keys contained escape characters, the user would have to include them when getting their value). Now, the string variables in all user-facing API calls are unescaped (i.e., the user does not have to manually escape the keys to get their associated value). All strings are also now properly returned unescaped, no matter how the JSON structure was constructed. Escaping is now done in all cases if necessary when the JSON is printed to a string, file or the console. [\#287](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/issues/287) [\#289](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/pull/289) ([jacobwilliams](https://github.com/jacobwilliams))

### [5.3.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/5.3.0) (2017-04-07)

[Complete Changeset](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/compare/5.2.0...5.3.0)
or [Download v5.3.0](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/releases/tag/5.3.0)

**Enhancements:**

- It is now possible to build a JSON structure by specifying the paths to the variables. The `update` routines also now use this new feature so if the variable is not present, it will be added using the path (formerly, it added it as a name, which was inconsistent). Renamed the argument to the `update` routines from `name` to `path`.
